needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving .
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .
i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
it did n't get finished .
we will not be coming back .
he could n't actually read her pressure , though .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much .
even the water tasted horrible .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
sounds good does n't it ?
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
it was over fried and very hard .
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
the overall prices are not competitive with fries .
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
and management does n't do anything about it .
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !
these days the quality is pretty lousy .
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
so , it went in the trash .
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .
so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .
when it finally came out , it was bad .
talk about false advertising so call before you go !
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
crab cakes , salt , no other flavor .
but the customer service ruins it all for me .
i just walked out , called the manager to complain .
i was very disappointed with this place .
so you are n't my problem . ''
unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts .
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
she does n't say anything and just walks away .
the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry .
the staff was nowhere to be found .
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
save your money & your patience .
what a waste of my time and theirs .
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .
the server was n't buying .
worst customer service i have ever had .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
and for this reason , i wo n't return .
this branch is getting worse and worse .
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
they can thank you for the low rating .
i did n't even eat it .
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
there was no personality to our server .
if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .
i did n't know ra was a chain .
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
maria the manager is a horrible person .
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
first , the bartender was an a -- hole .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
oh well , who cares ... right ?
we will spend our money elsewhere .
i will never purchase another lv bag again .
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
you can not judge people based on appearance .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .
no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
i would never recommend anyone to live here .
had to wait a month to get in .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
the food is not that authentic .
actually , just keep walking .
unfortunately , it is the worst .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
not so much these days .
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
this is the worst panda express location there is !
the door would n't open at all .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
this is a terrible college .
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor .
i looked around and there were still customers .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
avoid if at all possible .
i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?
went into this location to drop it off .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
the beer was nice and cold !
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
there are much better places for breakfast .
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful .
um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet .
pathetic place , worst food .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
anything they say , ask in writing .
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
the problem is nothing was good .
i tried to no avail .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
horrible job on nails and toes .
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi .
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out .
they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers .
desert followed but nothing special .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
however , this experience went pretty smooth .
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
she was getting pissed , and so were we .
did n't seem to care about their job .
would have rated lower if i could .
not personalized or warm at all .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
i do not like the size of the dance floor .
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .
ra sushi , you are so blah to me .
half of my head was over processed .
an old dude did my pedicure .
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price .
they do not stock some of the most common parts .
