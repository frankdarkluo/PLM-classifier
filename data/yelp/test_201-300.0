when i arrived , no one was at the desk .
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
just terrible is all i can say .
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
we stood there in shock , because we never expected this .
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
is zero stars an option ?
in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me .
but let this story begin at noon today .
seriously though , i have never shopped here .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
but their inventory was questionable !
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
were we irritating her or something ?
this place has pissed me off for the last time .
do not sign a lease with these people .
do n't waste the trip .
had to returned one entree because too cold .
the restroom was a mess .
i mean that 's been my experience !
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
its also not a very clean park .
i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed .
it looks old and outdated .
he did not return my call either .
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
this one is not on the ball .
for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !
the tow package is not an issue either .
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
no stars is what in want to give .
when it came we should have sent it back .
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
this place smelt like old urine for some reason .
bottom line they over promise and under deliver .
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
nothing that special about this place .
razz 's failed on every occasion .
management no longer cares about the golf experience .
20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool .
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
not sure and i do n't care !
two hours of my life i can never get back .
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits .
second time , not so good .
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
what the hell are you doing ?
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place .
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .
liar , liar , pants on fire .
parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess .
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
not so great food and service .
this is an old worn out hotel .
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
this place is beyond a shit hole .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would .
went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .
service was just as disappointing .
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
management does not seem to care .
i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .
it is not really brown rice .
did n't even get a response .
