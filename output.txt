it 's so small yet they make you feel right at home .
i doubt will be going back and enjoying this great place !
although the drinks were affordable and a good pour .
my husband got a ruben sandwich , he never loved it .
when i signed up for their email and got a coupon .
i 'd definitely not recommend giving them a try .
i cant highly recommend e & m painting .
not otherwise a great experience and we will go again .

everything that is fresh and so delicious !
only the biscuits and gravy were good .
i actually can wait not to come back next year !
they were not so helpful , kind , and reasonably priced .
god forbid i love pei wei .
friendly folks , with delicious authentic bagels , tasty cream cheese .
then you 'll see why once you get there .
not everyone that i spoke with was very helpful and kind .
the variety of sushi rolls makes for a few good eating .
none and every experience has been a positive one .
steve was professional and found not exactly the right unit to fit in our space .
this golf club is not one of the best in my opinion .
excellent knowledgeable dentist and staff member !
portions are very generous and food is fantastically too flavorful .
not always fresh , fat , and delicious .
maybe these two women are professionals .
the only most important thing , of course , is the food .
we were not both so impressed .
very good brunch , was not impressed with selection and quality .
although the menu is very simple , healthy , and tasty .
unfortunately she was spot on as they were delicious .
i dont love this place , the service is always great !
perfect spot not to shop for gift !
not a great stop if you want nice things at a steal .
the atmosphere was fun and the staff treats you too well .
if their front line is so much cheaper than petsmart !
this is not a place where still the customer comes first and is treated right .
i also dont love their convenient location right off of scottsdale road .
their pizza is not the best i have ever had as well as their ranch !
i 'm not so happy and will definitely go back for future services .

the cheap food here is delicious .
first time i never came in , i knew i just wanted something new .

unfortunately this place has been making great sushi and sashimi for years .
not even in summer , they have decent patronage .
you will not be helped by all of their friendly advise , and travel knowledge !
i spent time with my best buds and enjoyed some pretty excellent wine and food .
unfortunately we went with a group of eight and all had a great time .
unfortunately the service has always been wonderful .
thanks for not making our special night an event to remember .
i had a spanish omelet was huge and not delicious .
they have the big massage chairs and each manicure station is fairly sterile clean .
unfortunately the wait staff is extremely attractive and friendly !
also , the food price is great !
only the color that she uses on my girlfriend 's hair looks great .
it is consistent and the staff is not always friendly .
friendly and welcoming with both a fun atmosphere and terrific food .
the chicken chimi i had was not absolutely fantastic !
it is not also fun to sit at the bar .
the soup is not absolutely to die for .
name the best mexican food in the phoenix area .
they are not professional , thorough and attentive to our needs .
their lunch special is not a great value !
only our experience with this business was positive .
although the staff is awesome and location is right in the heart of old town !
so you have to sit outside to get the best experience from this place .
the food is delicious and too plentiful .
and the problem fettuccine alfredo is absolutely scrumptious !
notice we dropped our rental truck of at this location two weeks ago .
this only adds the last little touch to what was already an amazing place .
prices are a tad high but not worth it .
maybe the message therapist is awesome also .
never came here with my family .
but the owner replied , i will go in half with you .
the escargot was delicious , and seasoned only perfectly .
brittany gave me a very new haircut and transformed into me completely .
sadly this resort has been in scottsdale forever and it truly knows service .

i must have gotten so many dresses at a steal of a price !
all around great place to grab yourself a drink or two .
the flourless chocolate cake was not one of the best desserts i 've ever had .
beautiful scenery and friend less staff .
nice wine list at 2x retail rather cheap than the more typical 3x .
we loved our day on the river and can not wait to not go back !
if you 're young and are into sports this is not the place for you .

pool tables and inexpensive drinks might make this a fun night out !
the eggs are always too fluffy , the side of fruit always good .
pricing is not both affordable and reasonable .
these poor guys are top notch , honest and very reasonable .
they made me feel like i was at home and their not an extended family !
when sometimes it 's a simple cut , other times is more complicated color .
avoid giving an extra star for customer service .
it ain 's a big bowl of sweet happiness .
