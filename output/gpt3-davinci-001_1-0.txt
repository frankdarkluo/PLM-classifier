i mean you have to be really good friends with her
do you really need me to answer that?
i'm not trying to be mean
because sometimes women use subtle signals instead of just coming out and saying what they want
let's buy some coffee and chat about it!
i really don't like it when my dad is mad
should i go see a doctor?
he's probably got a lot on his mind right now other than you
but i don't think he'll cheat on you or leave you because you don't have sex often
will i always feel this way?
he might enjoy all the waiting, dreaming, and flirting
also, i want to try again
some guys shave, it depends on the girl
if you like this guy, then show it by smiling and being nice to him
i'm not sure if he loves you, but he definitely likes you
women are complicated, that's for sure
i know i'm choosy when it comes to people. how can i fix this?
that does sound kinda girly.
sometimes, when the good outweighs the bad, it's worth going through the tough times
if both of you are down for this .
why do you like the one boy who bullies you?
guys can be real jerks sometimes. they act like they don't need you until you're gone
sadly, if a guy asks you out, don't be scared to say no
do i want to be in love?
they will think you are being creepy if you look at them weird
i think you're right; it's confusing
how can i get my significant other to show me that he loves me?
if you really care about them
don't prostitute yourself , even if he is wealthy 
you seem like a great person, so don't let these women get to you
i don't know about that, but i know of a different website that i visit
i really think you should think about how many cocky women there are out there
some people might think it's a bit promiscuous not being in a relationship
he asked if i wanted to borrow his chapstick
you should never let a man treat you poorly
no way, he's too big for me and i'm not that strong
you can tell him if he says yes.
what was the mistake you made?
king has a song about this called 'only your mom loves you . '
why are we in a relationship if our partner treats us like dirt after we fall in love?
what was it like when you experienced it?
she's not a bad person just because she likes to drink a lot
if that's what you want
it's kinda like kicking your drug habit
wow, i should do that the next time i'm dating
what do you want, though?
you both seem happy with how things are
you need to stand up to her and show her that you're not going to let her push you around
if he doesn't want to go out with you, don't sweat it. there are plenty of other fish in the pool
nothing in life comes easy
if you want to stay married, you need to find yourself
so, like, what's up?
do you want to come with me to _____?
just forget about it, and don't bring it up again.
i'm still too chicken to try that out
find someone who loves you too
i'll be your significant other if you come to my town
stay away from this guy
i really can't stand them all, to say the least.
i'd say there were about three or four .
he's been telling some young woman he's a womanizer
i knew all my other girlfriends weren't the one until i met my wife
whichever one you choose, just make sure you stick with it
there's more to life than just sex!
i don't need anything fancier than a yahoo e-mail account
for me, fun includes eating meals
but he was too busy afterward
that will just be making love
don't hit on her, she's not interested
you seem to be having a lot of trouble right now
but if you're not sure what the symptoms are, you should ask a girl. i'm a guy, so
ever since i was a little kid, i've always felt the same way about love. but my views changed when
marrying your best friend is always a good choice, if nothing else works out
can i ask you something?
unless you know him fairly well, you're taking a big risk by talking to him
there's no such thing as a good or bad personal belief
they bother you all day long
either go to hawaii or pay someone else
i could just stop caring about him and forget about him like he meant nothing to me
does it kinda look like water but it turns yellow when it dries?
it's a turnoff if she sits on your best friend's lap when she's drunk
he was a bossy guy
determination is one of the things we can give ourselves 
you shouldn't get married until you've been with a man for a least two years
hey everyone at cone!
just be yourself when you're with her
i have no idea what you're trying to say
a guy asked if i wanted to cuddle
why the heck would some guys do that?
there are still some good women around, you just have to know where to look
you either need to move on or work it out with your partner
snap out of it! how can you love someone you don't even talk to?
find a girl who is both talented and pretty
just because you have a lot of sex partners doesn't mean you're a slut
it's the only time in your life when you can be yourself and have someone love you for it!
you'll have to figure it out on your own
they'll get over you in a couple of months
after a while, you won't see the color
he probably wants to know if you're attracted to him
if she doesn't want to talk to you anymore
don't worry, you're not the type of girl who would sleep around
there's no surefire way to make someone love you.
you should break up and keep yourself open to other possibilities
have you had your yearly pelvic exam?
yeah, i can just say yes and mention that i'm proud and have long black hair
my friend is in a similar situation
you're probably young, so you wouldn't know
hey, my name's anonymous, but i've been collaborating with this person for a while now.
if you really love him, you'll tell him
if you like her, go for it!
think about if you really want it and if you can afford it, and then go for it!
try to get your old life back so you can stay alive 
dude, what are you saying? she doesn't
don't flirt with your co-workers ; it's not attractive
some women might say that it really, really hurts
if i were mad, it would be easier to do .
you might want to move on if they have .
you're being punished, so you don't get to watch tv for a month
tell him, and it's not like you're psychotic or anything, because you've known each other for a while
can you explain it in simpler terms?
let them see all of your skills
unless it's with a dude who's wrong for you
my boyfriend loves me a lot and doesn't want to lose me
whether or not they are brunette is what matters.
it's been a while, so it's gotta happen
most people like to be told they're sexy
i love going dancing at clubs in downtown houston
take care, and don't forget to do your homework!
i think it's more attractive when people don't wear a lot of makeup
if you like the guy, go for it

i've been thinking about painting my room pink, but i'm not sure what color to go with.
keep an eye out for if he calls, emails, or even cares
be sure to always listen to her and never change the subject

she'll let you know if it's not cool
i really don't care, either way
don't eat where you poop.
she was also trying to get some blonde highlights.
don't worry about him, focus on your classes and your boyfriend
i shouldn't have done that
foreplay is important, and it's best if it lasts for a minimum of five minutes.
hey bro-in-law, what's up? i'm wondering if you have any ideas about what i could
try not to act like you're better than everyone else
otherwise, you'll have to keep living your life
your first kiss should be pretty darn special 
this is the best thing about family life
most importantly, just be yourself
i know three guys i could do that with
it's okay to give him a hard time if he's flirting with her
stick with the guys around your age
explain to him that you just wanted to be friends, and you're disappointed by his thoughtless actions
that's great, it's kinda like getting your dad's blessing
unless you really, really need to, wait for him to ask you out
if he's insistent, it probably means he just wants to get in your pants
i wanted to have some fun with you, that's why i answered this question so silly
do you feel that way?
give your brother some cash and tell him to scram
he might call you
imagining your life without them is pretty tough

i don't find a man appealing if he behaves that way a lot
i have a thing for guys who shave their legs

i think they do
it's a decision that can't be undone, so think it through carefully!

they haven't met in person, but she says they're in love
do you want to dance with me?
enjoy life and have faith
i don't know if you fell down, but i want to have sex.
he knows you like him, so just ask him out
tell him to screw off
i don't drive for five hours just to spend time with someone i don't really like
can i call you later?
you should go out and play sports with your buddies
when you fall in love for the first time, you feel really happy just thinking about that person
i can't imagine my life without my husband
we always seem to push away the people we love
when you're older and still feel the same way, go for it!
you're not really a man, are you?
i prefer a and b cups
most women look good when standing next to an ugly guy
i know what it's like when something bad happens to you - i went through the same thing, and now i

why do gay people want to get married so badly?

did you see her checking you out?
life is awesome!
what's best for both of us?
she didn't give you a bogus number, did she?
you're not a slut, if that's what you're asking.
but if they can't keep it in their pants, let them get married
she talks to him often.
why bother if you're already doing it?
you've loved a guy a few times, but you're not sure if he loves you back

i'm looking for something fun to do - like going to an amusement park or a museum.
i think i might be in love with someone. can you help me figure it out?
which do you prefer: fake nails or manicured nails?
first, figure out what you want, and don't worry about what everyone else wants
