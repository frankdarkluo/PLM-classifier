you have to be really close to her to be her friend.
?
i'm not planning on being mean.
because some women can be a little difficult to read
let's buy some coffee and chat. from there, we can figure out what to do next!
also, i don't like it when my dad is unhappy
ask him if he's okay
he probably has a lot on his mind right now, other than you.
but i don't think he'll be unfaithful or leave you because of the lack of sex.
will i always feel that way?
however, he may enjoy all of the waiting, dreaming and flirting
also, i would like to try again
some guys shave, it depends on the girl.
just nod your head and smile at him if you're interested
i'm not sure if he loves you, but he definitely seems to like you.
women are hard to understand
i realize i'm a bit picky when it comes to people. how can i stop this?
doing that does sound kind of girly.
sometimes, if the good outweighs the bad, then the difficulties are worth it
if you're both in the mood
why do you like the one boy who is always picking on you?
in addition, sometimes men think that they don't need you that much until you're gone
just say no if a guy asks you out
do i want to be in love?
they might think you're creepy if you stare at them.
i think you're right, it's confusing.
how do i get my significant other to show me that he's feeling my love?
if you love them, that is.
don't sell yourself short, even if he's loaded
don't let those women make you feel bad.
i don't know, but i know about another website that i visit.
i think you should consider how many over-confident women there are.
without being in a relationship , it might appear as if she's a little promiscuous
he asked if i wanted to borrow his chapstick.
you shouldn't ever allow a man to mistreat you
no, i don't think so, he's too big and i don't think i could handle him.
you can tell him if you want him to say yes.
what's up?
the king has a song about this, it's called 'only your mother loves you.'
why do we keep getting back together with people who treat us poorly after we fall in love?
if you've had it, what was it like?
it's not a big deal if she drinks too much.
if that's what you want, go ahead.
it feels like kicking a bad habit.
man, that was some great advice!
what's up?
it sounds like you're both comfortable with the status quo .
don't let her take over your life - she'll learn to deal with it eventually.
if he doesn't go out with you, it's not the end of the world. there are plenty of other guys out
nobody ever gives you everything you want.
if you want to keep your marriage together, you need to find yourself
just start with a basic question and go from there.
ask if they want to go with you on your next travel destination
just trust him and drop it .
i'm still trying to get over my nerves to try that out.
can you find the one who loves you, too?
if you're in town, let me know
stay the heck away from this guy
i don't really like any of them, to be honest.
i'd say there's about three or four of them
he's a womanizer and has been bragging to some young ladies.
i knew all my previous girlfriends weren't the one for me until i met my wife.
don't try to have both of them at the same time, okay?
sex isn't the only thing important in life!
i have an email address on yahoo, so that's good enough for me.
fun includes eating meals with friends
however, he had other things to worry about
that will just be sex
don't bother her and let her know that you find her looks pretty attractive
it sounds like you are going through a lot right now.
you should ask a friend about the symptoms, since i'm a guy
i had always felt the same way, but then i met my true love and my views changed.
your best friend is a good choice for marriage - they're the only one who's ever worked out for me.
can i ask you out on a date?
unless you know him well, you're asking for trouble by approaching him
if it's what you believe in, it's good.
they drive you crazy all day.
either go to hawaii or pay someone to do it for you.
i can just stop caring about him and move on.
does it have a similar color to a clear liquid when it dries?
it's a turnoff if she sits on your friend's lap when she's drunk.
he had a lot of personality
determination is a trait we can work on
you should only get married after you've been with a man for a while
hi, everyone!
just be yourself and she'll come back to you
i don't get what you're trying to say.
a man asked if i would care to cuddle with him.
what the heck is going on here?
a few good women are still around, you just have to look in the right places
you should either figure out what you're doing , or move on .
what was wrong with you?
find someone who is talented and pretty
that doesn't mean you're a slut
it's your only chance to live out a real love story!
you'll have to figure it out yourself.
give them a week or two and they'll get over you.
after a while, the color will disappear
he probably just wants to know if you're interested in him.
if she stops liking you
don't worry, you're not a slut
there's no way to make someone feel romantically towards you unless they want to.
you should break up with him and explore other options.
have you had your pap smear done yet?
i can just say yes and mention that i'm proud and have long black hair.
i know someone who's in a similar situation.
i don't know, are you young?
hi, i'm anonymous. we've been working together for years.
if you really love him, you'll tell him.
if you're really into her, go with your gut feeling.
thinking about it, can you really afford it? if you're sure, go ahead and buy it.
just get your old life back so you can stop being so miserable.
dude, you're saying she doesn't/aren't interested
don't use flirtatious dialogue; it's not attractive.
some women might say that it hurts a lot.
if i were mad, it would be easier to do
you should also be moving on if they have .
you're getting a punishment, so you can't watch tv for a month.
just tell him 
can you explain it to me again in simple terms?
give them a chance to get to know you better.
unless you want to be an idiot
my boyfriend says he loves me a lot
if they have dark hair or not
after a while, it's gotta be over.
everybody likes to be told they're sexy, even if they don't admit it. 
i like to go dancing at clubs in downtown huston.
have fun, but remember to do your homework
i prefer to go without makeup, if that's okay with you.
if you're curious about him, then go ahead and try it.
we're still technically divorced.
what do you mean by 'women don't have feelings'?
actions speak louder than words
i've been thinking about a light pink color, but what other colors should i pair it with?
look out for his call, email, or any other form of communication
listen to her, be sure not to ignore her, and don't change the subject.
he's the only source of income i have until i finish college.
she'll let you know if it's not okay.
i don't really care either way.
don't eat at the same spot you poop!
trying to get some highlights in her hair too
don't worry about him, he's probably just out with friends
i don't think i should have done that.
foreplay is important, and it should last at least five minutes. 
what do you think i could get him for his birthday?
try to be authentic and not act too ostentatiously
if you don't, you'll have to do it yourself.
your first kiss should be perfect
in a family, this is the most important.
just be yourself
i know three guys i could do that with.
you can hit him if he is flirting with her.
stick with the boys your age
just tell him that you're disappointed by his actions and want to be friends again.
that's good, it's a close match for getting your father's approval.
unless you're desperate, wait for him to ask you out
if he keeps insisting on it, that means he only wants sex.
i figured you might be up for a little fun, so i answered this question.
does that make sense to you?
give your brother some cash and tell him to get the hell out of dodge
you might call him
something you can imagine your life without them.
i pick the girl with the flowers in her hair.
do you like her?
men are more likely to get bored before women
flowers can be expensive, but you can save money by getting them from a cheaper place.
if you're not happy, then you need to fix it. or, you can just leave.
just because he has the potential to be a decent boyfriend, that doesn't mean he will be
you can pounce on someone and make them 'sarrested'
having a big penis doesn't mean you're good in bed. 
yeah, i think it looks good on most women.
men have a lot of secrets.
it kinda depends on the guy.
people asked me , why was i running so fast?
both of them don't respect your feelings
even though i see him every week in practice, i still can't bring myself to talk to him.
i don't really like men who act like that a lot.
i like men who shave their legs.
is he gay, or is he just curious?
i think they do
i'm not so sure about this decision - it doesn't look like it's going to go well.
i lost my virginity at sixteen in a park.
she says they are in love with each other
ask him if he wants to dance with you
have fun and be positive
can we order some food now?
he knows that you like him, so why not ask him on a date?
just tell him, will ya?
i’d only drive for five hours just to see her if i liked her a lot.
can i call you later?
you should play sports with your friends
when you first fall in love, you feel really happy.
i can't imagine my life without him.
we always seem to push away the ones we love.
if you both want to do it when you're older, then do it.
i call you 'man' very loosely when describing you.
personally, i prefer a and b cups.
any woman looks attractive when standing next to an ugly man
it happened to me, and i'm still on good terms with said person.
just tell her what you're thinking
show her your nudes
why do people who are gay look towards marriage?
we screwed on the hood of my car in the light rain
why are men supposed to act like that?
you'll need to do this a few times to get used to it.
while having intercourse is pretty much the best thing ever
right now, i think he's mad, upset, and not interested in being with you.
if anybody knows the answer, please let me know
the colors represent love, death, and so on.
i like someone who is a bit heavier because i feel like i can rely on them more.
if you don't know, ask someone who does.
his attempts to make it up to you will be clumsy
usually, the one who picks on you likes you.
yeah, i've been interested in her for a while now
did you see her eyes on you?
i never knew life could be so good.
what do you think?
at least she didn't give you a fake number, unlike some people.
i don't think that you are promiscuous
however, as long as they can control themselves, let them get married.
she calls him often, but he doesn't always answer
waste of time?
many times you've loved a guy, but you're not sure if he feels the same way about you
should i break up with him because of his mother?
if she doesn't respond, that's probably a good sign.
i have friends who get married after six months of dating.
show her what you can do
you'll look dumb.
that culture has something right
if you don't ask the question, people might think you don't care
don't worry about it too much.
what's the worst that could happen?
i'm confused and don't know what to do because i hate seeing her like this.
you should find someone who likes you
be polite
some men simply don't enjoy dancing.
this is not a smart generation .
it depends on if you think you can trust him.
they are unattractive and overweight because that is all they can get.
people get married for reasons
arguing is not worth it
have a good time in jail, asking your cell mate that question.
do you want to know if i like you?
what's up?
i have curiosity about sex with other females too!
twenty to thirty-two is cool, i don't care if she's younger or not. 
whenever that happens , you'll be able to make a decision more easily.
he cheated, but that doesn't mean i can't lift or carry my husband
make the best of a bad situation
are you looking for someone to talk to?
i think he would make a great valentine.
this is hard because of all the temptations.
do relationships usually take a year to feel comfortable or bored in?
it'll all depend on when you're ready.
of course, i'd love to meet women
it's just the way things are.
it's ok to be friends with someone online, but make sure to set some boundaries.
with whom would you like to start a family, if you could choose anyone ?
if he refuses your request, he's not worth your time anyway
actually, you'll learn it, but you'll have to do it yourself
hopefully, you married him because you like him.
i know someone who will be waiting for me when i get home.
take a break from it all and go get a massage .
i don't know where to start.
how do you look?
what do you mean, by your avatar?
if a man cares about you, he'll call you
in my opinion, there's a big difference between sex and making love.
you don't need to stay together, even if you have a child.
what's your hometown?
you can't postpone your studies, but you can delay your wedding.
i've never been to it.
would you like to be in a relationship with the same man ?
how often can you see pamela anderson?
you should make sure that getting your point across doesn't come across as aggressive.
this just really hits home for me, my mother also has cancer
i love running my fingers through curly hair
i'm talking about the both of you.
if you're patient, the right woman will come along.
i want my wife to grow too.
he's obviously uncomfortable, maybe you should make a move.
the doctor was surprised too.
you might not believe it, but it's true.
men don't, only little boys do
maybe ask them out on a date sometime soon
it happened to me once.
you don't need to feel the need to go out with a man because you're not interested in them.
you wouldn't be asking if you really wanted to be with him.
and i just hope it never goes away!
most women are waiting for a man to say something nice to them
women are way more passionate during sex
keep trying to impress her
kissing me on the forehead
i'm not that type of person, but i know people like that.
it all depends on how much you're starting to feel for this boy .
thanks in advance for the energy
why do people want to get married?
we like to be chased gently, with a little bit of chasing.
i’d love to go to an amusement park or a museum.
can you tell me if i'm in love with this person?
did you like the fake nails or the manicured nails?
start by making a list of what you want and don't worry about what everyone else wants
i don't get it.
i like the perfume you're wearing.
i think most men don't care, but it depends on the individual person.
it doesn't have anything to do with being weak or scared .
don't get married so early in the relationship.
you're not a good person if you plan to be unfaithful to your wife
if he's impressed, he might talk to you.
you're not interested in anyone , but that person .
he's getting married, so stop chasing him.
did you tell her how annoying it was having to check in with you every day?
when i moved in, my neighbor asked me out
most teen-aged boys prefer girls like enjoy sex
he played a great game of basketball.
don't worry, everything is going to be okay.
do you like to argue and fight?
the most important thing is not to get revenge on the person who wronged you
i was so excited when he said he wanted to move to chicago with me.
have you seen a doctor yet?
she wasn't a shrew, but the thin woman definitely was.
you should pursue an active life and not let me waste my time.
it's like over-indulging in chocolate and then getting mad because you get fat
i went there and he was there
if he's single, go for it
if you don't obey these people, they'll likely start beating your wife.
do you like him or not?
if you're sure, then you should tell your parents
many people will probably think you're weird.
do you think he has the same feelings for you as you do for him?
some men only say that word to make themselves feel powerful.
it seems like he likes you, and you should probably show him how you feel.
i think everyone should keep their own name.
friends are always there for each other because life goes by so fast
should have tried harder to imagine it was love
i think you should be prepared regardless of whether your relationship lasts through the four seasons.
some guys like those types, others don't. straightforward enough
if you want children, then you should definately be a homemaker.
do you think younger men and older women have a good idea or not?
he wants to keep going, but he's tired.
therefore, love must be properly labeled 
also, self-image is super important
i say those things and i'm a girl.
trust me, i've know lots of girls like that
flowers are pretty , even if they don't last very long
there are films i haven't seen yet.
she's a great person, just the one you're looking for!
maybe she doesn't love you, and that's okay
no offense meant; but, that does sound like a lady's name
i wouldn't bother calling him back
i don't have any women i'm attracted to in my list, so i choose my neighbor's spouse.
marriage is about sex and love
don't listen to anyone else's advice
what should i do to make her like me?
give them a rose!
i agree, it's unusual, but it's nothing bad.
just figure out what works for you two
they're woman enough for a man, but they're not as sophisticated as us.
especially when she became sick
i can not help you further without more information.
kissing is just something that happens, you don't really have any control over it.
take your time deciding
having fun with male friends is cool
i think it's more of a trust thing.
help me with this please
then move on if he doesn't like you
he's probably not interested either.
make it yourself whenever possible
can you do anything else besides work and fix things?
i told her i really loved her.
some of the senior guys think that freshmen girls are easy, which is really frustrating.
so, how do i get him to kiss me?
if you look for it, it should be there.
have fun
i don't think that's a good idea, you're not there for that reason.
it's a really long list.
i would say that the mountain is pretty rugged - you might be happy just hiking it.
if you don't base your relationship on sex, that's cool.
correct , it's a bad omen to see the future husband at the wedding ceremony.
hang in there
um, a small get-together with relatives
if you're not into performance art, then don't do it
i got married
i think it depends on a person's age and upbringing.
once you have kids, you'll need to figure out a last name . 
your child will find it hard enough growing up without a dad.
i don't find bald men attractive
what was the score of the last game?
if you're dating the guy you love, you need to get rid of your ex.
the easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married.
sure thing, let me know if you need anything else
i prefer small sizes, anything bigger is a waste to me.
joke around and then stab someone in the back
the performance has never been performed before, and it's really great!
my wife doesn't like those brands.
we don't know what you look like.
because opposites attract and they make a great pair
i think this is better than my personal life.
just don't go anywhere with that new date you went out with your ex.
talk to your best friend and see if they are okay with it. 
it worked for me, in about three to five days.
sometimes i don't like how he teases me about the little things
no, i'm not married yet.
lots of men like big women - mostly black.
if you like him, then you should not care; stay with him.
do they make fun of you when you're with him?
you shouldn't do it if you feel this way.
it depends on whether or not someone is vain.
you need to move on and find someone who loves you .
you should meet her and eventually one of you will ask the other out
i asked him if he was ignoring me
perhaps some guys enjoys the younger asian ladies
make sure it's your decision, okay?
just say you don't want a relationship and he'll probably get the hint
this is a tricky situation with lots of problems.
they've been good years, not always easy.
we've seen each other every day for four or five years now.
think that i am the man you want and then go out with me
flirting can never hurt!
you should stick with what you know
take care
do you think it's bad if i haven't kissed the girl i've been with for eight months?
it's up to her.
i think they look pretty cool.
i'm sure it'll be okay by the day after.
see if she's free for dinner tonight and a movie
some men just don't think about their partner when they first get to know them.
can you please speak english? i can't understand you very well.
i'm sorry, but i never have felt that way.
remember, no bird has ever tried to fly with just one wing
i think about this issue a lot.
if you appear to be down in the dumps, you probably won't find a significant other.
i met a girl recently and i want to know if she's interested in me.
don't just sit around and wait for the phone to ring - get out there and start contacting people!
shut up and just be yourself
just make sure you move on if he comes to his senses
he may love you, but he also might want to disappoint his dad.
you should take action asap
this woman doesn't want a man who is dishonest with her.
i would love to hear a woman's perspective on this issue.
can you help me win this debate?
almost always (not always) those are men similar in age to you, more or less.
who cares?
i'm not sure what to do.
you head to the bar and order a few drinks
i acted that way when i was around my present romantic partner.
if you're asking , then you probably don't have much confidence in yourself
just go up to him and say hello.
even though i'm getting divorced, i'm still stuck with this.
your girlfriend might think you're being a jerk
you might try to pursue young women, given the tendency of men to be offensive.
i dated my ex for three years and he cheated on me.
you'll know in time , and i think it's worth seeing what happens for six months .
well, the one i liked goes something like this.
some men break up with their women, while others keep them around
going there is always a blast, and there are always plenty of things to do.
should i kiss her on the first date?
i have a female friend. we're close.
they're both sexually attracted to each other.
my friend says that i am too nice, and that i should tell him no
but, do you really think there is always an exception to that?
not all men are like that, though
you can still keep your last name by doing this.
approach her and say hi . ask if she's single .
that really got me going sexually, but i chickened out
girls who are more muscular can still be attractive
some of the participants present at the meeting aren't actually attending the educational courses
practice tying cherry stems with your tongue
i'll pay you if you can give me the best answer.
you should look for somewhere in public where you feel most comfortable .
chat him up and see what he's like
and then i wouldn't have to feel so pressure to invite somebody over.
can i ask you out on a date?
she never forgets my mistakes.
how should i approach her, without her thinking i'm just another guy with bad intentions?
i might have some insights
don't worry, you're only thirteen.
always go trail riding with friends
if you two love each other , you'll figure it out.
it's important to make eye contact when you're talking to someone.
i can lift him with ease
he just has to start from scratch and win back your trust.
why did you ask her out?
if you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
play ' truth or dare ' together
just go with whatever you think is best and confirm it later
that's stupid because it's not in the textbook
just stop if you eat something like that
i keep thinking about her sex
if you want to know, you'll have to ask him directly.
jamie is going to ask rubi out on a date
the relationship is still going on because you're both too chicken to end it.
i think it would be interesting for them to learn about that .
he scores a few points
do men really like big women?
he loves you too, but only time will tell what will happen
if a man really loves you , he'll get where you're coming from
we've been getting into trouble
his answer works for me
you can still love him, but you need to move on.
